<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a rather simple Python script which makes use of Selenium's ability
to interact with the web browser to create a sophisticated bot capable of solving
most questions with absolute precision.

Some awesome features:
* Lightweight
* Runs in the background
* Solves nearly all questions
* Multi threaded
* Gain 12 million points per day (On 6 Threads)
* Instant setup and configurable

5. Using the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cookie-editor/hlkenndednhfkekhgcdicdfddnkalmdm?hl=en">Cookie Editor</a> extension, export your cookies which should copy them to your clipboard
6. Open `cookies.json` and clear all the text in the file and paste your cookies in
7. Note that you need to do this every time your cookies change (Which depends on your activity)
8. Modify `config.json` to your liking. Refer to the section below.

<!-- CONFIGURATION -->
## Configuration

This is a list of configurable options in the `config.json` file and what they mean.

| Configurable             | Description                                                                                                                                             | Default | Datatype |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|----------|
| `lastProcessedArticleID` | Saves the last processed article ID to prevent repeated processing. Do not modify this unless you know what you are doing.                              | 14      | int      |
| `articlesPerSession`     | Number of articles the script will process every time you run it. Once it processes that many articles, it will stop and exit.                          | 100     | int      |
| `threads`                | Number of threads to run. More threads means that the script will be able to solve more articles concurrently, but will also use more system resources. | 4       | int      | 
| `headless`               | If set to true, the browser will be invisible which increases performance. It is recommended to turn this on for quicker solving.                       | false   | bool     |
